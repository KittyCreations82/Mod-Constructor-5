  <Preset Label="I heard you're looking to make a difference here on Batuu. I might know of a group that could use your help, but I need to make sure your 'values' match up with theirs.

  <Preset Label="If you're still interested in becoming our ally, we could use your help disrupting First Order transmissions. Their technology is heavily secured, but we're hoping someone with your skills can slice in undetected. Meet with our “friend” at Oga’s Cantina. They have something for you to get you started.\n\nThis is a risky task...but actions speak louder than words. Show us your dedication and afterwards we’ll take you to Vi Moradi.&#xD;&#xA; (missionGig_Missions_Resistance_Story_02)" Value="239224" />
  <Preset Label="What's this I see? A fresh, new face! Care to join me in a game of sabacc? It's really the only proper way to get to know someone. What have you got to lose?

  <Preset Label="I am counting on you to spread the word about our vision of the future for Black Spire Outpost. The citizens must understand that everything we do is for their own good.

  <Preset Label="Why if it isn't one of the finest sabacc players I've ever had the pleasure of losing to! I have a little favor to ask of you, my friend.\n\nA ‘colleague’ of mine is holding a package for me, but he was called out of town on business before I could pick it up. There’s no way for me to get it without creatively bypassing his security. Don’t worry, I wouldn't ask you to break into a stranger’s home. We're old friends!\n\nGo speak with Dok-Ondar and he'll give you a dataspike. Use it to breach my friend's door and bring me his package... I mean, uh... MY package. Agreed? Wonderful!\n\n (missionGig_Missions_Scoundrel_Story_02)" Value="239702" />
  <Preset Label="Our patrols have reported suspicious activity and it appears that our suspicions were correct about the growing Resistance presence here on Batuu.\n\nFirst Order supplies have been tampered with. Question possible witnesses. We need more information as to the extent of Resistance involvement. These citizens need to see that there are consequences to actions taken against the First Order. (missionGig_Missions_FirstOrder_Story_2)" Value="239856" />
  <Preset Label="I don't encourage consorting with the vile scum of Batuu, but unfortunately they're a needed source of intel.

  <Preset Label="Routine testing of our ships is necessary to ensure a top fleet. I expect hard, honest work as you carry out these maintenance drills. Cut any corners and there will be consequences. (missionGig_Missions_FirstOrder_Repeatable_09)" Value="239924" />

  <Preset Label="This is our fight to win, but the locals are affected too. Keep an eye on them and see how the community is doing. We don't want them turning to the First Order out of fear or frustration. (missionGig_Missions_Resistance_Repeatable_08)" Value="241225" />
  <Preset Label="I've got a plan to get a better look at the First Order base, but the whole area will still be swarming with troopers.

(missionGig_Missions_Resistance_Repeatable_13)" Value="241226" />

  <Preset Label="A wanted criminal has been spotted at the Cantina. I suspect they've been feeding information to the Resistance. Arrest them.

  <Preset Label="I require one more crew member for a patrol mission I am sending to the outskirts of Black Spire. Report to the TIE echelon and remember: I expect nothing but the best. Anything less will be a severe disappointment. (missionGig_Missions_FirstOrder_Repeatable_05)" Value="241251" />
  <Preset Label="Keeping the citizens of Batuu in line is crucial. Don't earn respect. Take it. Demonstrate our power, and show them we will not tolerate opposition. The Empire fell. We will not. (missionGig_Missions_FirstOrder_Repeatable_13)" Value="241253" />

  <Preset Label="Word has it a scientist in Black Spire Outpost has been working on a new technology. It would allow us to seize command of all communications on Batuu.

  <Preset Label="I've been talking you up to Dok-Ondar. You're welcome, my friend! He is a great ally to have, especially during these times. Dok could use your help. His antiquities shop was ransacked... most likely by scrap rats.

It’s a tricky job, but I think you have what it takes!\n\nTake the &lt;i&gt;Falcon&lt;/i&gt; and work with Chewbacca to scout out the best possible routes from Batuu to Canto Bight. I'll be waiting to hear the details when you return. (missionGig_Missions_Scoundrel_Story_06)" Value="241648" />
  <Preset Label="A payout is only as good as the heist, and a heist is only as good as its plan. I'm counting on you to gather whatever supplies and crew we need to pull this off.

  <Preset Label="Now’s the time, my friend! I would give you a motivational speech, but as my mother always said, time is money.

Maybe I'll even dig out some celebratory Fuzzy Tauntauns… (missionGig_Missions_Scoundrel_Story_08)" Value="241651" />
  <Preset Label="We pulled it off! But the First Order is looking for us, my friend. Good at your job, but no good at covering your tracks, eh?

After that, we can continue our legitimate business partnership! (missionGig_Missions_Scoundrel_Story_09)" Value="241652" />

  <Preset Label="Things are falling into place, but the Resistance has found a way of hindering our work. They have begun an attempt to destroy our satellite relays. Without the relays our plans will be impossible. You were an integral part of securing our grip on Batuu's communications so it seems only fitting that you do us the honor of defending our efforts. Find a way to sabotage the Resistance, then take the TIE echelon to protect our satellites. When you succeed, report back to me.
