  <Preset Label="What's this? Who are you? What do you want from me?\n\nOh, you want to help?! We'll see about that. I've been meaning to get a pumpkin and that pub's been a hotspot of disgustingly flirty Sims! Show me you know the first thing about growing things and berating folks and maybe I'll have more for you to do.\n\nUgh, and I could use a drink! (questGig_VillagerHelp_AgnesCrumplebottom_1)" Value="260910" />
  <Preset Label="I've been meaning to pay a visit to some of my friends around the village, but I'm awfully busy. Would you mind taking a stroll and seeing how everyone's doing? (questGig_VillagerHelp_SocialShort_Mayor)" Value="261264" />

  <Preset Label="Oh, what's this? A fresh face? Always lovely to see someone new around the village. Can you be a dear and help me out with some things?\n\nI've heard that there's some juicy gossip around but I've only got two ears. Can you find a gnome who knows some things, and some Sims who don't know what they're missing?\n\nYou'll help, won't you? Oh, of course you will, I can see it in your eyes! (questGig_VillagerHelp_AgathaCrumplebottom_1)" Value="262235" />
  <Preset Label="It's lovely to see a new face around these parts, but I'm just too busy right now to make a proper introduction of myself. If you've the time and mind to be a help, would you be a dear and grab some of those grocery orders?\n\nOh, and I've forgotten to eat again! Not to mention that bouquet I was going to make for my friend! (questGig_VillagerHelp_GroceryOwner)" Value="262236" />
  <Preset Label="Have you been outside this village? I was born here and have been looking for a chance to explore beyond the borders of the woods and fences that seem to have defined my whole life.\n\nWould you mind helping to show me a bit of what I might be missing, or maybe even talking to the Mayor about my dreams? (questGig_VillagerHelp_GroceryDelivery)" Value="262237" />
  <Preset Label="I already know you'll love it here, but in case you need any convincing, I've arranged a little self-guided local tour!\n\nTake up these few - and fun, if I say so - errands and I'll make sure you get a small bundle of rewards at the end! (questGig_VillagerHelp_Mayor)" Value="262238" />
  <Preset Label="My pub's been rather successful but I'm always looking for the next big thing. I think I have a lead on a new and exciting drink we could offer here - and only here!\n\nBut running the pub keeps me busy and I could use a little help. What do you think? Would you like to help make some mixology magic happen? (questGig_VillagerHelp_PubOwner)" Value="262239" />
  <Preset Label="Do you like mushrooms? I love them! There are some really good ones out in these woods and I could use some help foraging them.\n\nYou seem like a lover of the natural world that surrounds us. Why don't you stick around and I can show you some of what I know? (questGig_VillagerHelp_CritterTender)" Value="262240" />
  <Preset Label="I'm not sure if you've got any creatures of your own, but I've been looking to get my hands on some fresh ingredients.\n\nCould you bring some to me and save me a bit of time going back and forth on my own? (questGig_VillagerHelp_LivestockShort_GroceryOwner)" Value="262486" />

  <Preset Label="How's that garden of yours going? You &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have a garden... right? I'm always on the lookout for some new plants! So it's settled then, you're going to help me? (questGig_VillagerHelp_GardenShort_AgnesCrumplebottom)" Value="262488" />

  <Preset Label="There's a lot of nature out there and try as I might, I can't keep an eye on all of it. I wouldn't mind having a second set of hands from time to time.\n\nSomething between a friend and a business partner, you know? Think that could be you? (questGig_VillagerHelp_WildAnimalShort_CritterTender)" Value="262493" />
  <Preset Label="You ever have one of those days where you've got too much to do and not enough time to do it?\n\nI need some ingredients for my next meal, but I'm not sure when I'll have any spare time. Would you be able to help me out? (questGig_VillagerHelp_FoodForageShort_GroceryOwner)" Value="262498" />

  <Preset Label="Ooh, I knew I could count on you. You're just what this village needs - a pair of fresh ears for catching all that gossip! Now, I've got an urge to do some meddling... well, actually -- I prefer to think of it as matchmaking! And my dear cousin Agnes has left me all this stuff to sell, which sounds frightfully dreary to do on my own.\n\nThink you can help me on both counts? (questGig_VillagerHelp_AgathaCrumplebottom_2)" Value="263017" />
  <Preset Label="Well, maybe you aren't so useless after all. If you really want to prove yourself, I've got some even bigger errands for you to do.\n\nAnd don't say I didn't warn you! I expect these will take you more time than just a shake of a llama's tail, if you catch my meaning. (questGig_VillagerHelp_AgnesCrumplebottom_2)" Value="263018" />
  <Preset Label="I'm starting to recognize you as a regular. By now, I'm sure you know your way around the plants and animals we have around here. Do you know what I'd love to see?\n\nI want you to show off everything you've learned! Do you think you're up for it? (questGig_VillagerHelp_LivestockGardenLong_AgnesCrumplebottom)" Value="263180" />

  <Preset Label="There's gossip out there and I don't know what it is! I mean, I don't need to know it all but I really want to.\n\nCan you go and figure out what the latest is? I'm too busy to go myself but I really must know! (questGig_VillagerHelp_SocialMedium_GroceryDelivery)" Value="263197" />

  <Preset Label="There's something about the woods, about being surrounded by the natural world, and letting your senses go. I want to share that with you.\n\nDo you trust me? I'm going to ask something of you, but it's really going to be for your own good. Are you ready? (questGig_VillagerHelp_WildAnimalFoodLong_CritterTender)" Value="263203" />
